#100DaysOfCode Log - Round 1 - [Tabitha O'Melay]

The log of my #100DaysOfCode challenge. Started on [Sept 06, Sunday, 2020].

## Log

### day 0/99
Worked through the last third of the lessond on freecodecamp for Responsive Web
Design & completed project 1/5. https://codepen.io/tabbykatz/pen/xxVpWOw
### day 1/99
FreeCodeCamp asked me to build a functional survey form and I might've been in
a mood: https://codepen.io/tabbykatz/full/BaKJxMo (2/5)
### day 2/99
I said initially that I wouldn't count school work for the challenge but... that was a mistake. I spent the entire day coding for school. We're at the RESTful API stage of an airbnb clone project and I might even be "getting it"!
### day 3/99
With a deadline approaching, I worked on airbnb clone most of the day. (Managed to fiddle around a bit with the "product landing page" project from #freeCodeCamp as well!)

Refactoring code in the clone has me wondering if "review" is even a word?
### day 4/99
Today is the last day of my airbnb project, but I also got in time on #freeCodeCamp and refreshed my Vim knowledge at openvim.com
### day 5/99
PLD for RESTful API. Some free code camp, not much.
### day 6/99
javascript with freeCodeCamp: I've played with it before but it's much more intuitive now that I have a strong C and python foundation.
### day 7/99
worked on project 2/5 for web design. researched capstone projects.
### day 8/99
first day of algorithms practice on LeetCode
### day 9/99
more algos on LeetCode, plus a javascript project. First day in many I didn't
get to FCC
### day 10/99
PLD day, evaluation quiz, preparing for final project. Played around on
Javascript.com
### day 11/99
today was a breakthrough for me with apis. studying alone is one thing, but
working with another who can help you expose your areas of relative weakness is
such win.
### day 12/99
Stumped on a #LeetCode problem?
Yes. And then, when you get it, you *get* it.
### day 13/99
I worked on a single #LeetCode challenge that I couldn’t make fast enough, and spend a few hours researching my capstone project for school. Not every day is a win.
### day 14/99
Much capstone project research today, which is the planning part of coding, I
suppose.
### day 15/99
Lots of coding today. Two algorithm study sessions, javascript practice and OH!
 I had to rebuild my entire environment from zsh on up. (Not complaining... applecare gave me a new laptop so that's stellar)
### day 16/99
 May this be my darkest day of 100 days of code. I discovered early this
 morning that I lost my private keys when I replaced my laptop. (I know, I
		 know, I should have X...) It was a huge blow. Still, did some algo
 work, javascript, and mapped out my final project for school. Tomorrow is a
 new day.
### day 17/99
 Today I learned about async await & promises in javascript. Also got the
 github cli working on my virtual machine!
### day 18/99
 There was coding between the many zoom meetings of today. I played with
 jQuery for the first time. I was dazzled by canvas! And I got to use bitwise
 XOR to solve a problem which is my Very Favorite Thing.
### day 19/99
 I think I might be addicted to algorithms. Halp?!
### day 20/99
 Missed another day of logging 100 days. But did work on the airbnb clone after breaking and fixing my VM.
### day 21/99
 days like this one really shake me. will I always be wrangling with jank,
 trying desperately to fix it, confronting my own inadequate understandings?
 Then there are days I feel confident: I am learning, even if that is not
 happening as quickly as I'd like.
### day 22/99
 web stack debugging. it's like the treasure field in LoZ: A Link to the Past
### day 23/99
DON'T RUN YOUR HAPROXY CONFIG SCRIPTS ON YOUR FECKING WEB SERVERS but if you did:
sudo apt-get purge --auto-remove haproxy
### day 24/99
no, you broke one of the servers you rebuilt yesterday. less coding more
planning for my portfolio project with an MVP spcification (my first!)
### day 25/99
long break due to illness that i was convinced was covid, but tested
negative.back at it now with react,struggling with css, but positively addicted
to this project.
### day 26/100
beautiful progress on the portfolio! i love React.
### day 27/99
feeling great about my react website & blog engine. Lots of tinkering today
with silly css tricks, finished importing content, tried to solve my
next.confic.js woes... another day.
### day 28/99
met with groups at school to share our progress on portfolio projects. Tried in
vain to nest more config in my next.config.js then allowed myself to be
entranced by three.js for awhile.
### day 29/99
I took the second half of the day off, but this morning I spent (yet more) time
looking into next.config.js, fidding with some styles, and resuming my
freecodecamp work.
### day 30/99
Got started on my landing page, rendered by the same react app as my project. I
struggled with Layout for a long time before I learned how to abuse it to make
a distict layout for the landing page. Still a WIP, but I am happy.
### days 31 & 32/99
I'm in the final week of my React project for school, and struggling mightily with end-of-build doldrums. What even is Javascript? Is CSS really awesome? WHY
### day 33/99
All the hard parts of deploying a project: slides, blog posts, landing pages, and readmes. These are just as much a part of it as any code.
### day 34/99
Finished my presentation slides and landing page today, no thanks to the many
shiny new concepts I stumbled into and wanted so badly to follow.
### day 35/99
Total overwhelm with final presentation on react build
### day 36/99
break for halloween. social distance outdoor movie with friends!
### day 37/99
finally set up my desktop with a new keyboard and everything in its place.
less coding and more making my environment comfortable.
### day 38/99
One week into Specializations, wrote a blog post and trying to get back into
100days
### day 39/99
It's amazing how the cobwebs have grown on both my #Python and #C. #LeetCode practice today cleared some of them, not all.
### day 40/99
Learning Chrome Dev tools. I know your first is always your favorite, but I strongly prefer Firefox's Dev mode.
### day 41/99
Learning #chrome devtools and feeling the love for my setup, which has gone from laptop-in-lap in bed to this through the generosity of friends
### day 42/99
Life, the Universe, and Everything

Reacquainting myself with #CSS.
### day 43/99
More #CSS today. Thank goodness for #vscode. Vim bindings, lovely colours, italics syntax highlighting, and all the best extensions.
### day 44/99
Finished my CSS project, starting on Markdown to HTML via Python (news to me). Also, received these fl-41 glasses as a gift. I have light-induced migraines and I'm hoping these will help.
### day 45/99
Finally got into the meat & bones of a #React course on #Udemy and find I am learning a lot little things about #javascript in general.
### day 46/99
I spent a day working under the miserable conditions of a broken keyboard, mapping swapped so that I had no command key. I didn't realize how much I depended upon it. (Fixed now)
### day 47/99
I joined @triple_byte
 today and took my first intro test. Timed & multiple choice, oh my! I'm proud of my results and excited to proceed with the fast track portion
### day 48/99
About halfway into round 1, I've learned a few things (ymmv):

Miss a day? Keep going.
All you're doing is school/work? It still counts.
'Don't let the perfect be the enemy of the good.'

Today: API research, a must before bending them to my will.
### day 49/99
Awww, my baby automated event creation is alive! I've spent today harnessing both the Github and Google Calendar APIs.
