# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Began 50 projects 50 days, started from the beginning in the YDKJS series (Up & Going).

**Thoughts:** This is my second attempt at 100 days, and I hope to be better about it. 
I am /this close/ to finishing my FCC Responsive Web Design Certification but I
know I need more practice to have truly earned it, hence the 50 / 50 class.

### Day 1: May 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project 1/50 complete! I also did some reading in the
YDKJS books and a few FCC lessons in ES6.

**Thoughts**: This is my first time using one of Brad Traversey's courses, so
it felt clunky as I became accustomed to his style. I feel like this course is
giving me just what I need right now: a lot of practice doing small things so
that they become more fluid.

### Day 2: May 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project 2/50 complete! more ES6.

**Thoughts**: brad moves very quickly but I am keeping up. Want to learn to
better use Emmett.

### Day 3: May 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project 3/50 complete! Also attended a live stream with githubeducation.

**Thoughts**: I struggled with many tiny errors and lazy typing issues today.
Was inspired by the live stream and hope to attend more things like that.

### Day 4: May 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4th project in 50/50 on Udemy, and spent some
time on HackerRank trying to get used to their platform which I currently find abbhorent compared to LeetCode.

**Thoughts**: I go back and forth in my first impulses when it comes to solving algos. Sometimes I handily break a problem down, other times I can't stop trying to think of a 'trick' to use.

### Day 5: May 19, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project 5 was 'Blurry Loading', a short and sweet but
elegant little trick. Also hit up free code camp & an algo or two.

**Thoughts**: I'm planning to do an online copde test for an internship
tomorrow. Not sure if I hope I fail this or the in person code challenge.

### Day 6: May 20, 2021

**Progress**: 6th project in 50 Projects 50 Days. Might jab at Free Code Camp
but I am keeping today light because I have a code challenege for a job
interview.

**Thoughts**: I know I have to jump into the world of interviewing, I just
don't know if I am ready to feel rejected.

### Day 7: May 21, 2021

**Progress**: 7th project, a longer one today. Some FCC and some algo practice. 

**Thoughts**: Yesterday was rough, but all I can do is keep going. Hey check
out my link for a repo full of python versions of all the algos in Cracking the
Coding Interview.

### Day 8: May 22, 2021

**Progress**: 8th one down, and I learned a bit. Probably start my Cracking the
Coding Interview (in python) project later.

**Thoughts**: Since some of my first Javascript was operating blind with other
people's code examples, it's fun to learn how and why things work and be able
to have these 'aha!' moments where I finally understand something I've used int he
past.

### Day 9: May 23, 2021

**Progress**: 9th project, a cute little sound board. I didn't get to CTCI
yesterday so that's next today.

**Thoughts** Udemy Sale is beckoning...

**Link**: sorry, got nothing today

### Day 10: May 24, 2021

**Progress**: Another day another project from 50/50, this time making fetches
of dad jokes... Also started a new Udemy course yesterday: The Coding Interview Bootcamp: Algorithms + Data Structures 

**Thoughts**: I'm certain that gridning algos is going to help me, in any
language. So far so good on the new course.

###Day 11: May 15, 2021

**Progress**: project 11/50 today! Small and fun, I always learn something. I
also worked through multiple common solutions for revstr and palindromestr in
javascript. 

**Thoughts**: Allergies make my head feel like it is full of glue
