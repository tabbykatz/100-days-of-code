# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Began 50 projects 50 days, started from the beginning in the YDKJS series (Up & Going).

**Thoughts:** This is my second attempt at 100 days, and I hope to be better about it. 
I am /this close/ to finishing my FCC Responsive Web Design Certification but I
know I need more practice to have truly earned it, hence the 50 / 50 class.

### Day 1: May 15, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project 1/50 complete! I also did some reading in the
YDKJS books and a few FCC lessons in ES6.

**Thoughts**: This is my first time using one of Brad Traversey's courses, so
it felt clunky as I became accustomed to his style. I feel like this course is
giving me just what I need right now: a lot of practice doing small things so
that they become more fluid.

### Day 2: May 16, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project 2/50 complete! more ES6.

**Thoughts**: brad moves very quickly but I am keeping up. Want to learn to
better use Emmett.

### Day 3: May 17, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Project 3/50 complete! Also attended a live stream with githubeducation.

**Thoughts**: I struggled with many tiny errors and lazy typing issues today.
Was inspired by the live stream and hope to attend more things like that.

### Day 4: May 18, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Completed 4th project in 50/50 on Udemy, and spent some
time on HackerRank trying to get used to their platform which I currently find abbhorent compared to LeetCode.

**Thoughts**: I go back and forth in my first impulses when it comes to solving algos. Sometimes I handily break a problem down, other times I can't stop trying to think of a 'trick' to use.
