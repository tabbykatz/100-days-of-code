# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 0: May 14, 2021

**Today's Progress**: Began 50 projects 50 days, started from the beginning in the YDKJS series (Up & Going).

**Thoughts:** This is my second attempt at 100 days, and I hope to be better about it. 
I am /this close/ to finishing my FCC Responsive Web Design Certification but I
know I need more practice to have truly earned it, hence the 50 / 50 class.
